In that folder you find our model specifications used to run ddm models on the value-guided choice phase as well as the patch leaving phase. 
In order to call those models and to save the results we have used a script written by Dr Anne Urai (https://github.com/anne-urai/2019_Urai_choice-history-ddm) and 
published under https://elifesciences.org/articles/46331. The ddm is fitted with the HDDM toolbox (Wiecki, Sofer & Frank, 2013) which can be downloaded here : http://ski.clps.brown.edu/hddm_docs/.
